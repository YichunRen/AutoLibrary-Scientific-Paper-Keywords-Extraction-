It draws from an extensive publicly available dataset of 1654 skeletal muscle expression microarray samples. Detailed, manually curated, patient phenotype data, with information such as age, sex, BMI and disease status, are combined with skeletal muscle gene expression to provide insights into gene function in skeletal muscle. It aims to facilitate easy exploration of the data using powerful data visualization functions, while allowing for sample selection, in-depth inspection and further analysis using external tools.

However, the characteristics of gene expression data have very-high-dimensional and small-sample-size which lead to over-fitting of classification algorithms. We propose a novel gene expression classification model of multiple classifying algorithms with synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) using features extracted by deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). In our approach, the DCNN extracts latent features of gene expression data, then the SMOTE algorithm generates new data from the features of DCNN was implemented. These models are used in conjunction with classifiers that efficiently classify gene expression data. Numerical test results on fifty very-high-dimensional and small-sample-size gene expression datasets from the Kent Ridge Biomedical and Array Expression repositories illustrate that the proposed algorithm is more accurate than state-of-the-art classifying models and improve the accuracy of classifiers including non-linear support vector machines (SVM), linear SVM, k nearest neighbors and random forests.", "date": "2019-11-27"}, {"link": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2395-8", "title": "Drug candidate identification based on gene expression of treated cells using tensor decomposition-based unsupervised feature extraction for large-scale data", "authors": [{"firstName": "Y.", "middleNames": [], "lastName": "Taguchi"}], "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough in silico drug discovery is necessary for drug development, two major strategies, a structure-based and ligand-based approach, have not been completely successful. Currently, the third approach, inference of drug candidates from gene expression profiles obtained from the cells treated with the compounds under study requires the use of a training dataset. Here, the purpose was to develop a new approach that does not require any pre-existing knowledge about the drug\u2013protein interactions, but these interactions can be inferred by means of an integrated approach using gene expression profiles obtained from the cells treated with the analysed compounds and the existing data describing gene\u2013gene interactions.ResultsIn the present study, using tensor decomposition-based unsupervised feature extraction, which represents an extension of the recently proposed principal-component analysis-based feature extraction, gene sets and compounds with a significant dose-dependent activity were screened without any training datasets. Next, after these results were combined with the data showing perturbations in single-gene expression profiles, genes targeted by the analysed compounds were inferred. The set of target genes thus identified was shown to significantly overlap with known target genes of the compounds under study.ConclusionsThe method is specifically designed for large-scale datasets (including hundreds of treatments with compounds), not for conventional small-scale datasets. The obtained results indicate that two compounds that have not been extensively studied, WZ-3105 and CGP-60474, represent promising drug candidates targeting multiple cancers, including melanoma, adenocarcinoma, liver carcinoma, and breast, colon, and prostate cancers, which were analysed in this in silico study.", "date": "2019-02-04"}]
