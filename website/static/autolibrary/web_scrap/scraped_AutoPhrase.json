The data are pre-filtered using a custom created knowledge base (KB) while the information is extracted using the Rule Based Information Extraction (RuBIE), a Natural Language Processing (NLP) and tagging tool. The extracted information is subsequently clustered and transformed into a relation graph of entities of interest.

Knowledge base schemas are often constructed manually using experts with specific domain knowledge for the field of interest. Once the knowledge base is generated then many tasks such as automatic content extraction and knowledge base population can be performed, which have so far been robustly studied by the Natural Language Processing community. However, the current approaches ignore visual information that could be used to build or populate these structured ontologies. Preliminary work on visual knowledge base construction only explores limited basic objects and scene relations. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal pattern mining approach towards constructing a high-level \"event\" schema semi-automatically, which has the capability to extend text only methods for schema construction. We utilize a large unconstrained corpus of weakly-supervised image-caption pairs related to high-level events such as \"attack\" and \"demonstration\" to both discover visual aspects of an event, and name these visual components automatically. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art visual pattern mining approaches and demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve dramatic improvements in terms of the number of concepts discovered (33% gain), semantic consistence of visual patterns (52% gain), and correctness of pattern naming (150% gain).", "date": "2016-10-01"}, {"link": "http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/570_Paper.pdf", "title": "DBpedia: A Multilingual Cross-domain Knowledge Base", "authors": [{"firstName": "Pablo", "middleNames": ["N."], "lastName": "Mendes"}, {"firstName": "Max", "middleNames": [], "lastName": "Jakob"}, {"firstName": "C.", "middleNames": [], "lastName": "Bizer"}], "abstract": "The DBpedia project extracts structured information from Wikipedia editions in 97 different languages and combines this information into a large multi-lingual knowledge base covering many specific domains and general world knowledge.
