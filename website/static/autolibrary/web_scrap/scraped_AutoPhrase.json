The aim of this paper is to discuss the nature of two type Ic supernovae SN 2007bg and SN 2007bi and their host galaxies. Both supernovae were discovered in wide-field, non-targeted surveys and are found to be associated with sub-luminous blue dwarf galaxies identified in SDSS images. Methods. We present BVRI photometry and optical spectroscopy of SN 2007bg and SN 2007bi and their host galaxies. Their lightcurves and spectra are compared to those of other type Ic SNe and analysis of these data provides estimates of the energetics, total ejected masses and synthesised mass of 56 Ni. Detection of the host galaxy emission lines allows for metallicity measurements. Results. Neither SNe 2007bg nor 2007bi were found in association with an observed GRB, but from estimates of the metallicities of their host-galaxies they are found to inhabit similar low-metallicity environments as GRB associated supernovae. The radio-bright SN 2007bg is hosted by an extremely sub-luminous galaxy of magnitude MB = \u221212.4 \u00b1 0.6 mag and an estimated oxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.18 \u00b1 0.17 (on the Pettini & Pagel 2004 scale). The early lightcurve evolution of SN 2007bg matches the fastpace decline of SN 1994I giving it one of the fastest post-maximum decline rates of all broad-lined type Ic supernovae known to date and, when combined with its high expansion velocities, a high kinetic energy to ejected mass ratio (EK/Mej \u223c 2.7). We also show that SN 2007bi is possibly the most luminous type Ic known, reaching a peak magnitude of MR \u223c\u2212 21.3 mag and displays a remarkably slow decline, following the radioactive decay rate of 56 Co to 56 Fe throughout the course of its observed lifetime. SN 2007bi also displays an extreme longevity in its spectral evolution and is still not fully nebular at approximately one year post-maximum brightness. From a simple model of the bolometric light curve of SN 2007bi we estimate a total ejected 56 Ni mass of MNi = 3.5\u22124.5 M\ufffd ,t he largest 56 Ni mass measured in the ejecta of a supernova to date. There are two models that could explain the high luminosity and large ejected 56 Ni mass. One is a pair-instability supernova (PISN) which has been predicted to occur for massive stars at low metallicities. We measure the host galaxy metallicity of SN 2007bi to be 12 + log(O/H) = 8.15 \u00b1 0.15 (on the McGaugh 1991 scale) which is \ufffd", "date": "2009-10-12"}, {"title": "The life cycle of XMM-Newton's \"Targets of Opportunity\"", "authors": [{"firstName": "M.", "middleNames": [], "lastName": "Santos-Lle\u00f3"}, {"firstName": "N.", "middleNames": [], "lastName": "Schartel"}, {"firstName": "M.", "middleNames": [], "lastName": "Guainazzi"}, {"firstName": "P.", "middleNames": [], "lastName": "Rodriguez-Pascual"}, {"firstName": "M.", "middleNames": [], "lastName": "Ehle"}, {"firstName": "M.", "middleNames": [], "lastName": "Breitfellner"}, {"firstName": "L.", "middleNames": [], "lastName": "Tomas"}, {"firstName": "F.", "middleNames": [], "lastName": "Jansen"}], "abstract": "Introduction The XMM-Newton (X-ray Multi-mirror Mission) observatory is the second Cornerstone of ESA\u2019s Horizons 2000 Scientific Programme. It offers astronomers simultaneous: \u2013 high-throughput non-dispersive spectroscopic imaging \u2013 medium-resolution dispersive spectroscopy \u2013 optical-ultraviolet (UV) imaging and timing from a co-aligned telescope (the Optical Monitor, or OM instrument). \u2013 GRBs are extremely energetic events whose nature is still far from being understood. Current models claim either the coalescence of a binary system of compact objects (such as black holes, neutron stars and white dwarfs), or the collapse of a massive star (hypernova). Observational evidence discriminating against the various models should come with measurements of X-ray emission lines. X-ray lines would also provide an estimate of their distance and a diagnostic tool for both the nature of the central engine and its environment, thereby probing the early Universe. \u2013 The X-ray emission from supernova explosions comes from the interaction of the shock wave with the interstellar matter. XMM-Newton observations of supernovae shortly after the expansion should provide spectra to test the models for the different types, and light curves to monitor the interaction between the shock wave and the interstellar matter. \u2013 Classical novae are stellar systems formed by a white dwarf and a giant star, where the mass transfer from the giant to the dwarf generates nuclear explosions in the hydrogen-shellburning white dwarf. They emit X-rays during outbursts via three different mechanisms: (a) luminous super-soft X-rays by the shell, (b) thermal X-rays (0.5 to 20keV) from shocks in the wind or the interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar material, and (c) hard X-ray emission due to Compton degradation of radioactive decay, which was predicted but never detected. XMM-Newton observations can be used to understand the properties of the shocked nova shell and the composition of the hard X-ray emission, to detect the supersoft component and to test the theoretical model predictions. \u2013 AGN is a term that refers to very energetic phenomena that occur in the cores of certain galaxies. They are suspected of containing super-massive black holes surrounded by accreting material moving so fast that it The term \u2018Target of Opportunity\u2019 (ToO) is used in astronomy to identify unpredictable events whose study is of the highest scientific interest. For XMM-Newton a ToO is an astronomical event observable by its instruments, which cannot be predicted and scheduled on the time scale of one year, yet is scientifically significant enough to justify the interruption of the ongoing observing programme. Here we discuss the kinds of objects that are suitable for observation as ToOs with XMM-Newton, their scientific interest, and how they are incorporated into the overall observing schedule in terms of target selection and mission planning. What has been done so far and the preliminary results for a few ToO examples are then presented.", "date": "2001-08-01"}]
